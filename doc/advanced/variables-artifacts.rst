Variables for Artifacts
-----------------------

.. TODO(diataxis) move to :doc:`../concepts/variables`

For specific situations where one needs to refer to individual compilation
artifacts, special variables (see :doc:`../concepts/variables`) are provided,
so the user doesn't need to be aware of the particular naming conventions or
directory layout implemented by Dune.

These variables can appear wherever a :doc:`../concepts/dependency-spec` is
expected and also inside :doc:`../reference/actions/index`. When used inside
:doc:`../reference/actions/index`, they implicitly declare a dependency on the
corresponding artifact.

The variables have the form ``%{<ext>:<path>}``, where ``<path>`` is
interpreted relative to the current directory:

- ``cmo:<path>`` and ``cmx:<path>`` expand to the corresponding OCaml
  artifact's path for the module specified by ``<path>``.

- ``cmi:<path>`` expands to the compiled interface for the specified module.

- ``melange.cmi:<path>`` expands to the Melange compiled interface for the
  specified module, including when that module is also selected for OCaml.

- ``cmj:<path>`` expands to the Melange compiled module for the specified
  module.

  .. versionadded:: 3.25

- ``cma:<path>`` and ``cmxa:<path>`` expands to the corresponding artifact's
  path for the library specified by ``<path>``. The basename of ``<path>``
  should be the name of the library as specified in the ``(name)`` field of a
  ``library`` stanza (*not* its public name).

- ``cmt:<path>`` and ``cmti:<path>`` expand to the corresponding compiled
  annotation files for the module specified by ``<path>``. These files contain
  the typed abstract syntax tree with precise location information and type
  annotations, generated with the ``-bin-annot`` flag. They are particularly
  useful for IDE tools to provide tooltips and type information.

  .. versionadded:: 3.21

The ``cmi``, ``cmt``, and ``cmti`` artifacts can be produced by OCaml or
Melange. If a module is selected for both compilation modes, these variables
refer to its OCaml artifact. Otherwise, they refer to the artifact for the mode
in which the module is selected.

For module artifacts, the basename of ``<path>`` should be the name of a module
as specified in a ``(modules)`` or ``(melange.modules)`` field.

- ``melange.emit:<path>`` expands to the output directory of the
  :ref:`melange.emit stanza <melange-emit>` whose target directory is
  ``<path>``. See :ref:`melange-emit-artifact-variable` for examples.

  .. versionadded:: 3.25

In each case, the expansion of the variable is a path pointing inside the build
context (i.e., ``_build/<context>``).
